Configuration
#######################################

The library initializes it's own config class just after being imported
(:meth:`init_config()`). There are two ways to customize the setup:

    1) create new :class:`Config` instance from scratch and activate with
       :meth:`replace_config()`;
    2) or preliminarily set the corresponding environment variables to intended
       values, and the default config instance will catch them up on initialization.
       Environment variable names are rendered in the documentation like this:
       :env:`PYTERMOR_VARIABLE_NAME`.

Variables
=================


.. _config.renderer_class:

Config.renderer_class
 Explicitly set default renderer class (e.g. ``TmuxRenderer``). Default renderer
 class is used for rendering if there is no explicitly specified one.
 Corresponding environment variable is :env:`PYTERMOR_RENDERER_CLASS`.
 See also: `guide.renderer_priority`.

.. _config.force_output_mode:

Config.force_output_mode
  is a standard for in-band signaling to control cursor location, color,
  font styling, and other options on video text terminals and terminal
  emulators. Certain sequences of bytes, most starting with an ASCII escape
  character and a bracket character, are embedded into text. The terminal
  interprets these sequences as commands, rather than text to display
  verbatim. Corresponding environment variable is
  :env:`PYTERMOR_FORCE_OUTPUT_MODE`.

.. _config.default_output_mode:

Config.default_output_mode
  is a standard for in-band signaling to control cursor location, color,
  font styling, and other options on video text terminals and terminal
  emulators. Certain sequences of bytes, most starting with an ASCII escape
  character and a bracket character, are embedded into text. The terminal
  interprets these sequences as commands, rather than text to display
  verbatim. Corresponding environment variable is
  :env:`PYTERMOR_DEFAULT_OUTPUT_MODE`.

.. _config.prefer_rgb:

Config.prefer_rgb
  is a standard for in-band signaling to control cursor location, color,
  font styling, and other options on video text terminals and terminal
  emulators. Certain sequences of bytes, most starting with an ASCII escape
  character and a bracket character, are embedded into text. The terminal
  interprets these sequences as commands, rather than text to display
  verbatim. Corresponding environment variable is :env:`PYTERMOR_PREFER_RGB`.

.. _config.trace_renders:

Config.trace_renders
  is a standard for in-band signaling to control cursor location, color,
  font styling, and other options on video text terminals and terminal
  emulators. Certain sequences of bytes, most starting with an ASCII escape
  character and a bracket character, are embedded into text. The terminal
  interprets these sequences as commands, rather than text to display
  verbatim. yare-yare-daze Corresponding environment variable is
  :env:`PYTERMOR_TRACE_RENDERS`.
