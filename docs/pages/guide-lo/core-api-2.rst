.. glossary::

   ASCII
      Basic charset developed back in 1960s, consisting of 128 code points.
      Nevertheless it is still used nowadays as a part of Unicode character
      set.

   ANSI
      ..escape sequence is a standard for in-band signaling to control cursor
      location, color, font styling, and other options on video text terminals
      and terminal emulators. Certain sequences of bytes, most starting with an
      :term:`ASCII` escape character (:ansi:`ESC`\ :hex:`0x1B`) and a bracket
      character (``[`` :hex:`0x5B`), are embedded into text. The terminal
      interprets these sequences as commands, rather than text to display
      verbatim. [#]_

   SGR
      ..sequence is a subtype of :term:`ANSI` escape sequences with a varying
      amount of parameters. SGR sequences used for changing the color of text or/and
      terminal background (in 3 different color modes), as well as for
      decorating text with italic font, underline, overline, cross-line, making
      it bold or blinking etc. Represented by `SequenceSGR` class.
