===================
pytermor
===================

`(yet another)` Python library designed for formatting terminal output using ANSI escape codes. Implements automatic "soft" format termination. Provides a registry of ready-to-use SGR sequences and formatting spans (or combined sequences). Also includes a set of number formatters for pretty output.

-------------------
Motivation
-------------------

Key feature of this library is providing necessary abstractions for building complex text sections with lots of formatting, while keeping the application code clear and readable.
