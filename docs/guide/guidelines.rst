*(mostly as a reminder for myself)*


- Basic types and built-in values should be surrounded with asterisks:

   ``*True*`` |rarr| *True*

   ``*None*`` |rarr| *None*

   ``*int*`` |rarr| *int*

- Library classes, methods, etc. should be enclosed in single backticks in order to become a hyperlinks:

   ```SgrRenderer.render()``` |rarr| `SgrRenderer.render()`

- Parameter names and string literals that include escape sequences or their fragments should be wrapped in double backticks:

   ````param1```` |rarr| ``param1``

   ````ESCÂ [31m```` |rarr| ``ESC [31m``

  On the top of that, ASCII control chars should be padded with spaces for better readability. Also this will allow to apply custom styles to them.
