Actual colors of *default* palette depend on user's terminal settings, i.e.
the result color of `Color16` is not guaranteed to exactly match the
corresponding color listed below. What's more, note that *default* palette
is actually a part of *indexed* one (first 16 colors of 256-color table).

   **(Verify)** The approximation algomanrithm was explicitly made to ignore these colors because
   otherwise the results of transforming *RGB* values into *indexed* ones would be
   unpredictable, in addition to different results for different users, depending
   on their terminal emulator setup.

However, it doesn't mean that `Color16` is useless. Just the opposite -- it's
ideal for situtations when you don't actually **have to** set exact values and
it's easier to specify estimation of desired color. I.e. setting color to ``'red'``
is usually more than enough for displaying an error message -- we don't really care
of precise hue or brightness values for it.

   Approximation algorithm is as simple as iterating through all colors in the
