.. note ::
    Almost all public classes are imported into the first package level
    on its initialization, which makes kind of a contract on library's API.
    The exceptions include some abstract superclasses or metaclasses, which 
    generally should not be used outside of the library, but still can be 
    imported directly using a full module path.
